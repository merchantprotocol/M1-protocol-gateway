Stage 1 will be a basic payment method implementation, with a CC form, and a few actions to authorize and capture payment, and report back to Magento.

##### Stage 2: Refund
Stage 2 will take care of any refund/fraud aspect of the module. Once Stage 1 is complete, we will be able to implement this on a solid and functional base

##### Stage 3: Enhancements
